# DarkOrbit-Header-Image-Downloader

An image downloader for a browser game called DarkOrbit.

The software scans all possible links ending with "modelXYZ" and as soon as an image is found, it downloads it.
The program was "secured" with an exception function that ignores the Error 404 when a link appears that is invalid.
